      <h3>What is DEV AIRDROP?</h3>
      <p>
        "Dev Protocol", a made-in-Japan DeFi protocol, is launching a "GitHub
        Airdrop" to commemorate its first anniversary of releasing
        "Stakes.social", a sponsor platform, and as appreciation for your
        contribution so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's hard for developers to rely on goodwill from patrons if they wish
        to continuously develop OSS as well as grow the community itself. We'd
        like you to use the airdropped DEV tokens to help stake other projects,
        while focusing on OSS development yourself. By using our Stakes.social
        platform, you can help other projects in need and have a stream of
        additional income by doing so.

      <h3>What are Dev tokens?</h3>
      <p>
        DEV tokens are a proprietary currency that can be used in the Dev
        Protocol. You can support OSS projects by using DEV tokens and help
        developers with sustainable funding of their projects.

      <h3>What is Dev Protocol?</h3>
      <p>
        "Dev Protocol" is a technology that realizes sustainability for
        creators' activities. It is mined by creators, and also a reward for
        users supporting creators through a process called staking. Because Dev
        Protocol is completely decentralized and is a middleware protocol for
        on-chain governance, anyone can join the ecosystem by developing various
        applications (Dapps).
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the mission of "creating a society where all innovators are valued
        and can achieve sustainably", Dev Protocol started MVP in 2018 and began
        a service for OSS developers to monetize. After the release of
        "Stakes.social", our first Dapp, in June 2020, our sustainable incentive
        scheme that utilizes a blockchain, attracted attention from overseas,
        and its ecosystem continues to grow dramatically. In the last one year,
        the total number of staking reached around 6 million USD, and the
        cumulative total amount of reward went up to approximately 2 million
        USD. (as of April 2021)

      <h3>What is Stakes.social?</h3>
      <p>
        Stakes.social is a new sponsor platform where both developers and
        sponsors are rewarded with tokens if they support their favorite
        projects by staking dev tokens. Over 1,600 OSS projects issue tokens
        (utility token with ERC-20 form), and many developers, including both
        individuals and firms, succeed in achieving sustainability through
        fundraising. There is an increasing number of unique creators joining
        Stakes.social, so you can support different creators such as OSS
        developers, VR artists, NFT markets, green projects, and Vtubers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>What's Staking?</h3>
      <p>
        It is a framework where people contribute to the network by locking
        (temporarily making inaccessible) their crypto assets. In terms of Dev,
        when people stake "DEV token" (ERC20) for to support creator's works,
        they are rewarded with dev tokens for doing so.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>When will the reward be distributed?</h3>
      <p>
        The distribution of rewards is scheduled to start on August 20th. But it
        may change.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How is the number of contributions calculated?</h3>
      <p>
        Calculated based on the geometric mean of annual public contributions on
        GitHub over the last three years.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How many contributions do I need to distribute?</h3>
      <p>
        It is calculated based on the geometric mean of the past 3 years, and
        those who have a result of 300 or more are eligible. However, if the
        number of applicants exceeds the target, the results will be distributed
        in descending order.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Why are private contributions not covered?</h3>
      <p>
        This Airdrop is aimed at contributors to the OSS ecosystem. In the case
        of private commit, it is excluded because there are many contributions
        other than OSS.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How long can I enter?</h3>
      <p>Entry is open until 23:59:59 UTC on July 1st.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How is it distributed</h3>
      <p>
        After accepting the entry, we will examine the entry contents and
        confirm the target person. Will be distributed after that.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>What do I need to claim</h3>
      <p>
        To create an Ethereum transaction for claiming purposes, a small amount
        of ETH is consumed as a gas fee. The gas fee will vary depending on
        Ethereum congestion, but it is safe to set aside around 0.005 ETH.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Can I enter for my friends instead?</h3>
      <p>
        If you enter using someone else's Github username, it will be
        fraudulent.
